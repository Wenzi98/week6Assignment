##  Part 1: Essay Questions

### üîπ Question 1: Edge AI vs. Cloud-Based AI

**Edge AI** processes data locally on devices (e.g., sensors, drones) rather than relying on cloud-based servers.  
Key advantages include:

- **Low Latency**: Crucial for real-time decision-making (e.g., autonomous drones).
- **Enhanced Privacy**: Data remains on-device, reducing breach risks.

**Example**: Drones inspecting power lines analyze video feeds onboard. This allows immediate path correction and keeps sensitive footage local.

### üîπ Question 2: Quantum AI vs. Classical AI

**Classical AI** relies on heuristic algorithms and faces challenges with complex optimization problems.  
**Quantum AI** utilizes qubits and quantum properties (e.g., superposition, entanglement) to solve problems more efficiently.

**Industries Poised to Benefit:**
- **Pharmaceuticals**: Molecular simulations for drug discovery
- **Logistics**: Global supply chain optimization
- **Energy**: Real-time grid balancing with renewables
