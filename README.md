AI and Emerging Technologies: Comprehensive Analysis and Proposals
Part 1: Essay Questions
Q1: Edge AI vs. Cloud-Based AI
Edge AI processes data locally on devices (e.g., sensors, drones) instead of sending it to the cloud:

Latency Reduction: Eliminates network round-trips (critical for autonomous drones making split-second decisions)

Enhanced Privacy: Sensitive data (e.g., facial recognition) never leaves devices

Example: Power line inspection drones analyze video feeds on-board, instantly adjust paths when faults are detected, and prevent industrial espionage by keeping raw footage local

Q2: Quantum AI vs. Classical AI
Aspect	Classical AI	Quantum AI
Optimization Method	Heuristic algorithms (e.g., gradient descent)	Qubits (superposition/entanglement)
Search Complexity	O(N) for unsorted databases	O(√N) using Grover's algorithm
Industry Applications		
- Pharma	Limited molecular simulation	Drug discovery via molecular interaction
- Logistics	Suboptimal route planning	Real-time global supply chain optimization
- Energy	Reactive grid management	Renewable load balancing with fluctuations
Q3: Human-AI Collaboration in Healthcare
Radiologists: AI pre-filters scans, flagging anomalies (30% workload reduction)

Nurses: Wearable AI predicts patient deterioration (e.g., sepsis) from vitals

Societal Impact:

Democratizes expertise (rural clinics access diagnostics via smartphones)

Requires ethical guardrails against over-reliance
