Conceptual Essay Questions

Applied Use Cases & System Designs

Futuristic AI Innovation Proposal

Part 1: Essay Questions
🔹 Question 1: Edge AI vs. Cloud-Based AI
Edge AI processes data locally on devices (e.g., sensors, drones) rather than relying on cloud-based servers.
Key advantages include:

Low Latency: Crucial for real-time decision-making (e.g., autonomous drones).

Enhanced Privacy: Data remains on-device, reducing breach risks.

Example: Drones inspecting power lines analyze video feeds onboard. This allows immediate path correction and keeps sensitive footage local.

🔹 Question 2: Quantum AI vs. Classical AI
Classical AI relies on heuristic algorithms and faces challenges with complex optimization problems.
Quantum AI utilizes qubits and quantum properties (e.g., superposition, entanglement) to solve problems more efficiently.

Industries Poised to Benefit:

Pharmaceuticals: Molecular simulations for drug discovery

Logistics: Global supply chain optimization

Energy: Real-time grid balancing with renewables

 Question 3: Human-AI Collaboration in Healthcare
AI supports—not replaces—medical professionals by:

Radiologists: Automated scan pre-analysis reduces workload.

Nurses: Predictive wearable AI helps prevent sepsis.

Societal Impact: Enhances rural healthcare via AI-powered mobile diagnostics, but requires strong ethical oversight.
